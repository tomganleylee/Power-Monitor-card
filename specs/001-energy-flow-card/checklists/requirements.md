# Specification Quality Checklist: Home Assistant Energy Flow Visualization Card

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks completed successfully

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. Update frequency: User-configurable (1-5 seconds) with 2-second default
2. Device grouping: Expandable/collapsible categories with hierarchical power calculation for circuit-level monitoring
3. Warning conditions: Visual alerts with user-configurable threshold conditions

**Spec Quality Summary**:
- 7 prioritized user stories (1 P1, 4 P2, 2 P3) covering all major use cases
- 23 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-023) all testable and unambiguous
- 10 measurable success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) all technology-agnostic
- 8 edge cases identified with clear expected behaviors
- 7 key entities defined with attributes and relationships
- Zero implementation details in specification - focused entirely on user value and business needs

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (if additional clarifications needed)
