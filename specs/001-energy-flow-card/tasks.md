# Tasks: Home Assistant Energy Flow Visualization Card

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-energy-flow-card/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/card-config.schema.json

**Tests**: Tests not explicitly requested in specification. Focus on implementation tasks with manual testing.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Project root**: `energy-flow-card/`
- **Source**: `energy-flow-card/src/`
- **Tests**: `energy-flow-card/tests/`

- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 node rendering but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 with battery visualization, independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Configuration interface, independently testable
- **User Story 7 (P2)**: Can start after US2 complete (needs device nodes) - Adds category grouping
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after US1 complete (needs layout system) - Responsive design overlay
