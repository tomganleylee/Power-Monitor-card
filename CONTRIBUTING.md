Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Energy Flow Card project! We welcome contributions from the community.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 9 or higher
- Git
- A Home Assistant instance for testing

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/energy-flow-card.git
   cd energy-flow-card
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development mode**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts Rollup in watch mode - any changes you make will automatically rebuild.

4. **Test in Home Assistant**
   - Copy `dist/energy-flow-card.js` to your Home Assistant `/config/www/` directory
   - Add the card to a dashboard
   - Make changes and refresh your browser to see updates

### Building

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Build and watch for changes
npm run dev
```

### Code Style

- **Formatting** - Code is automatically formatted (if you have a formatter configured)
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/Methods: `camelCase`
  - Private methods: `_privateMethod` or use TypeScript `private` keyword
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Files: `kebab-case.ts`

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, well-commented code
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Test your changes thoroughly

3. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   # or

   ```

   Use conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` - New features
   - `fix:` - Bug fixes
   - `docs:` - Documentation changes
   - `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
