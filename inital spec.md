Home Assistant Solar Power Flow Card - High-Level Spec
Core Concept
A compact, animated Sankey-style visualization showing real-time power flows between Solar, Battery, Grid, and consumption points, optimized for kitchen tablet display.
Key Components
1. Power Sources/Storage (Left Side)
Solar Panel - Shows current generation (W/kW)
Battery - Shows charge %, capacity, charging/discharging state
Grid - Shows import/export status and rate
2. Animated Flow Visualization (Center)
Smooth, "snakey" animated paths showing power direction and magnitude
Flow thickness represents power amount
Color-coded flows (e.g., green=solar, blue=grid, yellow=battery)
Animated particles/gradient moving along paths for real-time feedback
3. Consumption Breakdown (Right Side) Hierarchical display with expandable sections:
Sockets: (could be multiple ring mains but just shown as 1)
Sockets breakdown
Network equipment (detailed)
Toms PC
Other devices
Device-specific monitoring
Lights (total W across circuits)
AC
EV cars
Other tracked loads
4. Constraints
Max height: ~400-600px (configurable for tablet)
Responsive width: Full tablet width
Update frequency: 1-2 second refresh for smooth animations
Touch-friendly: Expandable sections for detail drilling
5. Key Features
Net power calculation (showing overall import/export)
Peak/average indicators
Collapsible consumption categories
Visual warnings (battery low, high grid usage)
Time-based color themes (day/night)
Technology Stack Considerations

6. battery stuff
should show battery %
shoudl haev large battery icon that fills disfills
should have kwh and kwh remaining, 
should have time to empty 

when creatinga  card it shoudl support the gui for easy creation and adding of entiteis 


we need to ensure power can flow between solar battery and grid as well. 

we are making the sample image.png whic we also have as a html, we will be using the particals to show power flow, with higher desntiy of particles, depending on where the entergy is coming they should be diffrent colours, power between teh grid/battery/solar should also be shown as well as to the consumering items on the righ t
the html example is here energy-field-dashboard.html - we can use this as a base for ideas, 

the card must scale with diffrent sizes, both in height and width, 

Perfect! I've created a standalone, production-ready HTML file for the Energy Field concept. Here's what's included:
Features:
✅ Complete standalone HTML file - CSS and JavaScript all in one file
✅ Home Assistant integration ready - Contains connection code for HA entities
✅ Demo mode - Works standalone with simulated data
✅ Fully responsive - Adapts to different screen sizes
✅ Interactive nodes - Click to see more info (when in HA)
✅ Real-time updates - Data refreshes automatically
✅ Active state indicators - Pulsing rings show which sources are active
✅ Particle animations - Energy flow visualization
Entity Configuration:
The dashboard expects these Home Assistant sensors:

sensor.solar_power
sensor.battery_power
sensor.grid_power
sensor.total_power
sensor.lights_power
sensor.computer_power
sensor.tv_power
sensor.ac_power
sensor.other_power

You can edit the entity IDs in the JavaScript section to match your actual sensor names.
To Use:

Open the file and modify the entity IDs to match your Home Assistant sensors
Upload to Home Assistant as a custom dashboard panel
Or use it with the Home Assistant dashboard builder tools
